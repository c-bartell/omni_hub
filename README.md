# README

## Project Requirements:
OAuth is an important skill to understand and implement. It will be required on your group project coming up and everyone should have practice implementing it. You will be given some ideas on how to mock out the OAuth workflow before the break.

Build a VERY simple Rails app (not an --api), and implement GitHub OmniAuth to authenticate a user to view a list of their public repos and a separate list of their private repos. (free accounts include unlimited private repos; make a few private repos that just contain a README)

Create a README for your project which includes screenshots of the functionality.
